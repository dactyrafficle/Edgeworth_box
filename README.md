# Edgeworth_box
a little drawing

an Edgeworth box with 2 people and 2 goods - each person has an initial endowment of each good

that initial endowment is a bit like a budget constraint

so each person makes their demand function

supply is fixed as the total endowment for that good

prices equilibrate on that basis

let py = 1, so that we can solve for (px/py)
